You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Project Notes

### The `linkAccount` event from NextAuth

- For email signed in with OAuth provider, we don't need `emailVerified` field in User Schema, because GG or Github already verified the user existed. 

Therefore, we could use this event to automatically populate the emailVerified field with current Date()

- Only user went through normal register => login flow will receive email to verify they're real human in their inbox.
